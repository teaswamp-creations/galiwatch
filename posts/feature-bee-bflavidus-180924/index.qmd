## *Bombus flavidus* - after a long absence the yellowish cuckoo bumblebee is back on Galiano!

### Background

*B. flavidus* (also known as *B. fernaldae*) the yellowish cuckoo bumblebee is the world's most widespread bumblebee (1). Cuckoo bumblebees are social parasites; bees that have lost the ability to collect pollen and raise their young. Instead, they invade the nests of other bumblebee species, take over the colony by killing or subduing the queen, and make the worker bees raise their offspring for them. This species is thought to takeover nests of a wide range of bumblebees, including those in the subgenus Pyrobombus -- the fiery tailed bees. Galiano's six bumblebee species are all Pyrobombus: *B. flavifrons* (yellow-fronted bumblebee); *B. melanopygus* (black-tailed bumblebee); *B. mixtus* (fuzzy-horned bumblebee); *B. sitkensis* (Sitka bumblebee); *B. vancouverensis* (Vancouver bumblebee); and *B. vosnesenskii* (yellow-faced bumblebee)*.*

### *B. flavidus* in the Pacific Maritime

If we take a look at the historical record, we find *B. flavidus* was first reported in the Pacific Maritime region in 1934, with specimens collected in Agassiz, Hope, and Mt Cheam in the Fraser Valley (2). The next documentation was in the 1950s, by which time, in addition to the previous specimens found in the Lower Mainland, *B. flavidus* was also found in Manning Park, the Greater Vancouver area, and on Vancouver Island (3). In 2005, specimens were again collected on Vancouver Island and subsequently, in 2013, in Abbotsford and Tsawassen (4).

Beginning in 2017, iNaturalist (5) observations have significantly added to the knowledge base giving insight into more recent *B. flavidus* distribution in this region. As of September, 2024, a total of 286 research grade observations have been submitted to iNat, beginning with a singleton in 2013 followed by multiple sightings from 2017 onward. These observations are consistent with *B. flavidus* being wide ranging throughout BC (6).

Since the first iNat observation in 2017, *B. flavidus* has been repeatedly spotted on the North Shore and up the Sunshine Coast, among other places. It made its iNat debut on Vancouver Island in 2023, with subsequent sightings in Victoria, Nanaimo and the Gulf Islands in 2024. The figures below show annual trends in *B. flavidus* observations from 2017 to2024.

### Plant associations

Being a cuckoo bee, *B. flavidus* chooses flowers for their nectar not their pollen. To better understand cuckoo bees habits, we looked in our BC BeePlant Database (generated from iNat observations and Plantnet ID to Nov, 2023) to check out which flowering plants *B. flavidus* has been photographed on most frequently. We have 51 observations for *B. flavidus* that include 25 genera of plants (Table). *B. flavidus* was most commonly seen on goldenrod, pearly everlasting, yarrow, fleabane, sow thistles, and American asters. Checking the recent Galiano observations, we saw the plant hosts were goldenrod, topped lavendar, oxeye daisy, and gumplants. Although it looks like *B. flavidus* may prefer nectaring on some flowers over others, it is clearly a generalist when it comes to snacking.

### So what do we know about *B. flavidus* on Galiano?

Andrew Simon has reported in depth on the historical changes in Galiano's bumblebee community (7). The [Biodiversity Galiano Lifelist](https://biogaliano.org/taxa/) includes 11 species that have at some point in time been found on Galiano. Of these, six are currently present (listed above), three are likely extirpated; i.e., locally extinct -- *B. insularis*, *B. occidentalis*, and *B. suckleyi* -- and two others *B. fervidus* and *B. flavidus* have only ever turned up once in the historical record (7).

That is until now!!

As reported in iNat, *B. flavidus* was spotted mid-Island in late May of this year, and then several more times at the South end of Galiano in early June.

Happily, these little cuckoo bumblebees are back, and if they successfully stole bumblebee homes on Galiano this year, we may see even more of them next year. And, who knows, as Galiano's iNat enthusiasts continue to upload new observations, perhaps in future we'll see other "lost" bumblebee species reappearing, and new ones arriving to make Galiano their home.
