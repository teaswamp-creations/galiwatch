In addition to monitoring trends in air quality, the particulate matter sensor should give us an estimate of pollen count and detect smoke from wildfire drift.\nAs well as piloting the technology, these observations will be a window to the day-to-day ins and outs of Galiano pollinators that will help us better understand how wildflowers and pollinators are affected by local weather events."

    "text": "Wild pollinators are an integral part of native plant communities and are highly effective at pollinating flowers in natural ecosystems. Plant pollination is essential for plant reproduction, which in turn provides fruits and seeds for wildlife. Abundance and diversity of pollinators ensure a stable, highly productive ecosystem.\nChanging environmental conditions caused by weather, climate change, or human interventions, may disrupt pollinator activity for some species but enhance it for others. Within natural ecosystems, biodiversity and abundance of wild bee populations and other non-bee pollinators provides redundancy that ensures ongoing pollination and plant productivity despite a changing environment.\nManaged pollinators, most commonly honey bees, are super-generalist pollinators that are essential for, or enhance, the pollination and production of many agricultural crops. We rely heavily on honey bees for certain types of food production - for example they are considered essential to sustaining the global supply of almonds - and support billions of dollars worth of food production worldwide. So, it is very worrying that beekeepers report honeybee populations are dwindling, and that their colonies are becoming increasingly vulnerable to environmental stressors.\n\n\n\nAdapted from: 2019-2020 Honey Bee Colony Losses in the United States: Preliminary Results. Accessed April 12, 2021\n\n\nAlongside honey bees, wild pollinators including bumble bees (genus Bombus), other types of bees, wasps, and other non-bee species also make important contributions to crop production. Interestingly, on organic farms near natural habitat, wild bees can provide full pollinator services and, as long as diversity is maintained, there is sustained success.1\nIt seems possible then that by making adjustments that favour abundance and diversity of wild pollinators we could build capacity and resilience within natural and agricultural ecosystems that offset shortfalls in managed pollinator services resulting from the ongoing, perplexing losses of managed colonies.\n\nBumble bee species in flux in British Columbia\n Decline of bumble bees has been reported in North America and Europe and is of significant global concern.2 Although there are over 500 known bee species in British Columbia, there is not a lot of historical information about pollinator populations to use as a baseline. However, we do know that at least one bee species, the western bumble bee, B. occidentalis, has significantly declined.3 The authors discuss how this bee used to be very common in the lower mainland in the 1980s, representing 25-30% of bumble bee species collected on local berry farms, but by 2003/2004 had dwindled to less than 1% of the bees collected. Since then, B. occidentalis was sighted just a handful of times on Vancouver Island in 2012, and once in the lower mainland at Boundary Bay in 2013. According to a local newspaper report, it was last spotted on Galiano in 1990. In contrast however, it seems the yellow-faced bumble bee, B. vosnesenskii, may be gaining ground in the region.4\nGaliano’s bumble bees have recently been under scrutiny in a study to better understand their reliance on habitat diversity in this semi-arid ecosystem 5. The author identified six species of bumble bees that frequented flowering shrubs in various habitats through spring and summer, and saw fluctuations of bumble bee abundance in different habitats (wet, dry, modified, natural) as the summer progressed. Overall, the Vancouver bumble bee B. vancouverensis was the most abundant species, followed by the Sitka bumble bee B. sitkensis, while the yellow-faced bumble bee B. vosnesenskii was least abundant, perhaps reflecting it has only recently made it to the island. Bumble bee activity and blooming peaked in June in habitat similar to our study site, but even as flowering slowed high numbers of bumble bees were found to persist through July.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nKremen C, Williams NM, Thorp RW.

    "text": "Smokey air exchange\nThe air INSIDE our building changes more slowly than the air OUTSIDE. Last night there was a lot of smoke in the air until the afternoon, when it became very windy and the smoke was replaced with clean air from the north, such that the PM2.5s outside went from above 20 down to 1-2 in about 10 minutes. Let’s call this “almost instantly” (see Figure 1, blue line).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Indoor/outdoor air exchange\n\n\n\n\nThe PM2.5s inside the building then dropped in a nicely exponential fashion (gold line in Figure 1 above, or the blue line plotted on a log scale to the right), allowing us to estimate the half-time for replacement of the indoor air (Figure 2). The slope is -.0012, so the half-time for the replacement of the air inside the building was 577 minutes, or around 9.5 hours.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Indoor air replacement half-life estimation\n\n\nThis seemed surprisingly FAST(!) since all the doors and windows were closed and there was no one at the building and no ventilation. However, the EPA standards for building ventilation recommend 0.35 air changes per hour for residential buildings, or turnover every three hours. However, that is for places with active air exchange, rather than just leaky doors, windows and walls. This air turnover rate of ~9.5 hours is for when it is VERY WINDY, and probably the actual turnover on normal days is quite a bit less.\nAssuming air exchange with a half-life around 10 hours also lets us create a model (red line in figure Figure 4) of both the actual indoor PM2.5 and the temperatures as a function of the outdoor values. Actual indoor values are shown in orange and outdoor in blue. Over a larger timeframe of three days (4500 minutes), the fit of the PM2.5 is not great (see Figure 4, middle panel), suggesting that the wind-assisted value we calculated might have been a bit too fast for when it is not windy (which started around at the 3000 minute mark).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Models of air exchange with different half-lifes. Note: Blue lines are actual outdoor PM2.5, orange lines are actual indoor PM2.5\n\n\nHowever, this is much better than an indoor PM2.5 model assuming exchange of 1 hour (the indoors would look like the outdoors) or 100 hours (indoor would be almost independent of outdoor), so we are in the right order of magnitude.\n\n\nTemperature\nAs another “reality check” we can also make the same simple exponential model of indoor temperature as function of outdoor temperature. Once again, assuming a half-life of around 10 hours gives us a reasonable reflection of the outdoor value, whereas the 1 hour and 100 hour half-lives are plainly unreasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Models of temperature change with different half-lifes. Note: Blue lines are actual outdoor temperature, orange lines are actual indoor temperature.\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nUsing an estimated air exchange of 10 hours gives reasonable approximations of indoor PM2.5 and temperature, suggesting that air exchange is driving both, which makes sense. Probably we have discovered the value of insulation."

    "text": "Air quality management in British Columbia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBC actively monitors air quality and is part of the national Air Quality Management System (AQMS). The AQMS divides provinces into air zones that exhibit similar air quality characteristics - BC has seven air zones. Galiano is in the Georgia Straight Air Zone, which includes Victoria, Nanaimo, Comox, Campbell River, Whistler, Squamish, and Powell River.\n\n\nWeather Data & Air Pollution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir quality changes with the weather. Wind, rain, humidity and other weather parameters can all influence how air pollutants move around.\nNitrous oxides, carbon monoxide, ammonia, sulphur dioxide, methane, and carbon dioxide are polluting gases that may be emitted into the atmosphere in harmful amounts. Our enviro air quality sensors detect oxidising (e.g., NO2) and reducing gases (e.g., CO and ammonia) rather than individual gases, and can reveal trends of increasing or decreasing air quality.\nIn our setting, we are most likely to detect gaseous pollutants as a result of smoke from wood burning stoves (common in our setting) or wildfires (drifting smoke), as well as from vehicle exhaust due to proximity to roads.\n\n\nAir pollution – particulate matter (PM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPM 2.5 refers to fine airborne particles with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less. They are produced by many human activities and natural sources including vehicle exhausts, forestry operations, wood stoves, wildfires, and wind. Fine particulate matter may be harmful to health.\nPM 10 refers to all solid and liquid airborne particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less. These particles come from lots of different sources and are highly variable as a result. Many are formed by chemical or physical processes in the atmosphere. Inhaling PM 10s may also be bad for your health.\nBC’s air quality objectives reflect the maximum acceptable level of pollutants according to national air quality targets. The 24 hour average air quality objectives for PM 2.5 (24hr) and PM 10 (24hr) are 25 µg/m3 and 50 µg/m3, respectively.\n\n\nNO2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBC’s air quality objective for NO2 (primary oxidising gas detected by our sensors) is 100 parts per billion (ppb) averaged over a 1-hour period. For the two-week period from Apr 4–17, NO2 (1hr) levels measured in Victoria (Colwood City Hall) ranged from approximately 3-12 ppb, while our resistance readings ranged from approximately 10-1550 ohms. If we assume the air quality variation across the Georgia Straight air zone is representative for our site, a change in resistance of 170 ohms is equivalent to a change in NO2 of around 1 ppb.\n\n\nCO and NH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) and ammonia are reducing gases. Our enviro sensors provide a qualitative estimate of their concentration in the atmosphere with decreasing resistance measurements corresponding to decreasing air quality. Resistance readings for reducing gases and ammonia through April ranged from 90-260 Ω (around a 3-fold change), and from 90-1500 Ω (around a 16-fold change), respectively. At this time of year, wood stoves and local traffic are likely major contributors to fluctuations in air quality."

Wildfire smoke particles typically range from 0.4–0.7 microns, dust is around 2.5 microns, while pollen is generally 15 microns or more.\n\n\n\n\nAdapted from Jisaac9, Mieszko the first, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons"

The cameras have been situated so that they point down towards the patches of salal and dull Oregon grape. By positioning the cameras about a meter from the tops of the plants, we can film an area of about half a square meter with high resolution. The cameras are set to take a picture every minute and the images are stored on the SSD."

    "text": "Bees and other pollinators of Galiano Island\nAlthough our two test plants salal and dull Oregon grape are particularly attractive to bumble bees, many other species of pollinators have been sighted on Galiano and we are interested to see if any of these are captured in our images. Our reference resource for insect identification is the Biodiversity Galiano project, a community-based initiative to document the flora and fauna of Galiano Island, initiated in January 2016. So far, over 2,500 species have been reported of which more than 1,000 are arthropods. Among these are 82 species of bees and wasps including honey bees (Apis mellifera), bumblebees (Bombus spp.) mining bees (Andrena spp.), long-horned bees (Eucera spp.), mason bees (Osmia spp.), cuckoo bees (Nomada spp.), sweat bees (Halictus and Lasioglossum spp.), blood bees (Sphecodes spp.), and various wasps.\nWe will use this database to help ID any pollinators we see in our time-lapse images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith systems up and running we hope to collect data from late March to early September including:\n\nImages of Salal and Dull Oregon grape from bud burst to fruit maturation.\n\nImages of pollinators showing when and how often they come to visit, and enabling identification of different species.\nDay-to-day weather data, including high and low temperatures, pressure, humidity (Raspberry pi and Acurite), wind speed and direction, total rainfall, UV and light intensity (Acurite only). This will enable comparison of the two systems, and establish reproducibility of the instruments.\nClimate data including average, maximum and minimum temperatures; light intensity; pressure; wind speed, and total rainfall accumulation.\nEstimates of reducing and oxidising gases, and ammonia representing trends of increasing or decreasing air quality, and estimates of particulates, such as dust, pollen, mould spores, smoke etc.\n\nIn addition to piloting the technology, the images and weather data will provide baseline information about our test site including:\n\nDate of bud burst and duration of flowering of salal and dull Oregon grape.\nPollinator community composition visiting these plants during the flowering season (bees, hoverflies, butterflies, moths, wasps, other flies, beetles, hummingbirds).\nTime of first appearance and seasonal dynamics of different pollinators.\nHow much of a role, if any, non-bee visitors play in the pollination of these two native plants.\nHow hyperlocal weather and variations in air quality influence pollinator activity.\n\nThe images and weather data will add to what is already known about pollinators in coastal Douglas-fir ecosystems on the west coast of British Columbia and provide additional information about pollinator behaviour both throughout the day and day-to-day while plants are in bloom."
