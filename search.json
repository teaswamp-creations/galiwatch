    "section": "",
    "text": "Reading time: 3 minutes\n\nSmokey air exchange\nThe air INSIDE our building changes more slowly than the air OUTSIDE. Last night there was a lot of smoke in the air until the afternoon, when it became very windy and the smoke was replaced with clean air from the north, such that the PM2.5s outside went from above 20 down to 1-2 in about 10 minutes. Let’s call this “almost instantly” (see Figure 1, blue line).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Indoor/outdoor air exchange\n\n\n\n\nThe PM2.5s inside the building then dropped in a nicely exponential fashion (gold line in Figure 1 above, or the blue line plotted on a log scale to the right), allowing us to estimate the half-time for replacement of the indoor air (Figure 2). The slope is -.0012, so the half-time for the replacement of the air inside the building was 577 minutes, or around 9.5 hours.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Indoor air replacement half-life estimation\n\n\nThis seemed surprisingly FAST(!) since all the doors and windows were closed and there was no one at the building and no ventilation. However, the EPA standards for building ventilation recommend 0.35 air changes per hour for residential buildings, or turnover every three hours. However, that is for places with active air exchange, rather than just leaky doors, windows and walls. This air turnover rate of ~9.5 hours is for when it is VERY WINDY, and probably the actual turnover on normal days is quite a bit less.\nAssuming air exchange with a half-life around 10 hours also lets us create a model (red line in figure Figure 4) of both the actual indoor PM2.5 and the temperatures as a function of the outdoor values. Actual indoor values are shown in orange and outdoor in blue. Over a larger timeframe of three days (4500 minutes), the fit of the PM2.5 is not great (see Figure 4, middle panel), suggesting that the wind-assisted value we calculated might have been a bit too fast for when it is not windy (which started around at the 3000 minute mark).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Models of air exchange with different half-lifes. Note: Blue lines are actual outdoor PM2.5, orange lines are actual indoor PM2.5\n\n\nHowever, this is much better than an indoor PM2.5 model assuming exchange of 1 hour (the indoors would look like the outdoors) or 100 hours (indoor would be almost independent of outdoor), so we are in the right order of magnitude.\n\n\nTemperature\nAs another “reality check” we can also make the same simple exponential model of indoor temperature as function of outdoor temperature. Once again, assuming a half-life of around 10 hours gives us a reasonable reflection of the outdoor value, whereas the 1 hour and 100 hour half-lives are plainly unreasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Models of temperature change with different half-lifes. Note: Blue lines are actual outdoor temperature, orange lines are actual indoor temperature.\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nUsing an estimated air exchange of 10 hours gives reasonable approximations of indoor PM2.5 and temperature, suggesting that air exchange is driving both, which makes sense. Probably we have discovered the value of insulation."

It first appears in the records in the 1950s when a few specimens were found in the interior of BC, and there was talk of it being assigned threatened or endangered status. By 2000 however, it had expanded through the Okanagan and Similkameen valleys, as well as having become firmly established in the Pacific Maritime region 2."

    "text": "Reading time: 3 minutes\nWild pollinators are an integral part of native plant communities and are highly effective at pollinating flowers in natural ecosystems. Plant pollination is essential for plant reproduction, which in turn provides fruits and seeds for wildlife. Abundance and diversity of pollinators ensure a stable, highly productive ecosystem.\nChanging environmental conditions caused by weather, climate change, or human interventions, may disrupt pollinator activity for some species but enhance it for others. Within natural ecosystems, biodiversity and abundance of wild bee populations and other non-bee pollinators provides redundancy that ensures ongoing pollination and plant productivity despite a changing environment.\nManaged pollinators, most commonly honey bees, are super-generalist pollinators that are essential for, or enhance, the pollination and production of many agricultural crops. We rely heavily on honey bees for certain types of food production - for example they are considered essential to sustaining the global supply of almonds - and support billions of dollars worth of food production worldwide. So, it is very worrying that beekeepers report honeybee populations are dwindling, and that their colonies are becoming increasingly vulnerable to environmental stressors.\nAlongside honey bees, wild pollinators including bumble bees (genus Bombus), other types of bees, wasps, and other non-bee species also make important contributions to crop production. Interestingly, on organic farms near natural habitat, wild bees can provide full pollinator services and, as long as diversity is maintained, there is sustained success.1\nIt seems possible then that by making adjustments that favour abundance and diversity of wild pollinators we could build capacity and resilience within natural and agricultural ecosystems that offset shortfalls in managed pollinator services resulting from the ongoing, perplexing losses of managed colonies."

In addition to monitoring trends in air quality, the particulate matter sensor should give us an estimate of pollen count and detect smoke from wildfire drift.\nAs well as piloting the technology, these observations will be a window to the day-to-day ins and outs of Galiano pollinators that will help us better understand how wildflowers and pollinators are affected by local weather events."

The first pollinator was a bumble bee caught on camera that afternoon. We collected approximately 850 pics per day (16,000+ pics collected during the observation period) and found only 123 pics with bees in them. That’s less than 1%!!\n\nIn addition to bumble bees we observed a few butterflies and bee flies, as well as other small flies."

    "text": "Reading time: 2 minutes\nSummer 2021 was a hot one for BC: record temperatures from the Western Heatdome, and record forest fires. We picked up evidence of the fires from our monitoring site - here’s a brief summary of what we saw.\nWe’ll read in our data: air quality measures from our Purple Air sensor\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\n# read in air quality data, and prepare variable names\nair &lt;- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaswamp-creations/galiwatch.ca/quarto-website/posts/fires-220223/2021_temp_and_PM.csv') %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Row Labels` = as_date(ymd_hms(`Row Labels`))) %&gt;%\n  rename(Date = `Row Labels`,\n         PM1.0 = `Average of PM1.0_CF1_ug/m3`,\n         PM2.5 = `Average of PM2.5_CF1_ug/m3`,\n         PM10.0 = `Average of PM10.0_CF1_ug/m3`,\n        `Temp C` = `Average of Temperature_F`)\n\n\nLooking at the air quality data, we notice a few things. Firstly, all the PM values have peaks in the same places, and they don’t seem too well-correlated with the outdoor temperature.\n\n\nCode\nair %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(c(PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10.0, `Temp C`)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(name = ordered(name, levels = c('PM1.0', 'PM2.5', 'PM10.0', 'Temp C'))) %&gt;%\n  group_by(name) %&gt;%\n  mutate(rollmean = zoo::rollmean(value, 10, align = 'right', fill=NA)) %&gt;%\n  ggline(x = 'Date', y = 'rollmean', color='name', plot_type='l', size=1, alpha = 0.8) + \n  labs(title = 'Air Quality Measures in Summer 2021',\n       subtitle = 'Rolling 10-day average', \n       y='Value', color = 'Measure') + \n  scale_colour_manual(values = c('lightblue', 'orange', 'salmon', 'grey')) + \n  theme(legend.position = 'right')\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t all that surprising, and we can see the correlation is very close to 1 for the different PM sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPicking just PM2.5, we can remake the first plot, this time showing the daily average, without the 10-day smoothing we used before. This gives us a more granular view of air quality events.\n\n\nCode\nair %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(c(PM2.5, `Temp C`)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(name) %&gt;%\n  ggline(x = 'Date', y = 'value', color='name', plot_type='l', size=1, alpha = 0.8) + \n  labs(title = 'Forest Fires cause Temperature and PM2.5 to spike',\n       y='Value', color = 'Measure') + \n  scale_colour_manual(values = c('orange', 'grey')) + \n  theme(legend.position = 'right') + \n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%b\", date_breaks = \"1 month\") + \n  \n  geom_label(aes(x = ymd('2021-05-15'), y = 30, label = \"June heatdome\"), \n               hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5, label.size = NA, size=3.5, family='xkcd') +\n  geom_curve(aes(x = ymd('2021-05-15'), y = 32, xend = ymd('2021-06-20'), yend = 40), \n             colour = \"#555555\", curvature = -0.3, size=0.8)+  \n  geom_label(aes(x = ymd('2021-06-15'), y = 55, label = \"Air quality advisory\\nissued for metro Vancouver\"), \n             hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5, label.size = NA, size=3.5, family='xkcd')+ \n  geom_curve(aes(x = ymd('2021-06-15'), y = 51, xend = ymd('2021-08-10'), yend = 45), \n             colour = \"#555555\", curvature = 0.25, size=0.8)+ \n  geom_label(aes(x = ymd('2021-11-05'), y = 45, label = \"Likely woodsmoke from\\nlocal fireplaces\"), \n             hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5, label.size = NA, size=3.5, family='xkcd')+\n  geom_bracket(xmin = ymd('2021-09-15'), xmax = ymd('2021-12-30'), y.position = 40, label='', size=0.8, tip.length = 0.02)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can clearly see the peak in temperature when BC got hit by the heatdome. We hypothesize that winter spikes in PM2.5 happen when nearby houses burn wood in their fireplace for heating, as they seem to be associated with relative dips in temperature."

We’ll try to do batch correction for this, by assigning a batch number to each position, and subtract the average from the x and y direction. I think we can reasonably split the changes in position (the batches) simply by the date. This is easy to see in the ymid variable - the feeder moves twice in May, and once in June.\n\n\nCode\nbird %&gt;% \n  mutate(Month = month(Date, label=T)) %&gt;%\n  filter(Date&gt;'2021-05-01' & Date&lt;'2021-06-15') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=Timestamp, y = ymid))+ \n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_wrap(\"~Month\", scales = 'free_x') + \n  theme_pubr() + \n  labs(title = 'Feeder Moves Up and Down in May and June')\n\n\n\n\n\nLets split these into batches for correction.\n\n\nCode\nbird$batch &lt;- 1\nbird$batch &lt;- ifelse(bird$Timestamp &gt; ymd_hms('2021-05-08 00:00:00'),2,bird$batch)\nbird$batch &lt;- ifelse(bird$Timestamp &gt; ymd_hms('2021-05-11 00:00:00'),3,bird$batch)\nbird$batch &lt;- ifelse(bird$Timestamp &gt; ymd_hms('2021-06-13 12:20:00'),4,bird$batch)\nbird$batch &lt;- factor(bird$batch)\n\n\nWe can check it went as expected by recolouring the previous plot by batch\n\n\nCode\nbird %&gt;% \n  mutate(Month = month(Date, label=T)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(xmid = (xmax+xmin)/2, ymid = (ymax+ymin)/2) %&gt;% \n  filter(Date&gt;'2021-05-01' & Date&lt;'2021-06-15') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=Timestamp, y = ymid, color=batch))+ \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_wrap(\"~Month\", scales = 'free_x') + \n  theme_pubr() + \n  labs(title = 'We can Infer Position Batches Based on When the Feeder Moves',\n       colour = 'Batch')\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we’re ready to correct!

We can still see two dips, as noted previously. The dips we see around 18,000 and 38,000 bounding box size are surprising, this means that there are certain height/width combinations that are not being picked up very frequently. This may indicate that there are certain positions on the feeder at which we can’t effectively identify birds.\nWe see this even more clearly by plotting bird height against width.\n\n\nCode\nbird_scaled %&gt;%\n  ggscatter(x = \"Width\", y = \"Height\",  alpha = 0.6, size=1) +\n  labs(title = 'Mid-sized birds are hard to call?') + \n  theme(legend.position = 'right', legend.direction = 'vertical') +\n  scale_color_ordinal(option='D')\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s some height/widths with no birds observed at them! To check whether this may be related to out classifier’s ability to call these birds, we can colour this plot by the confidence level (recall: we already filtered the data such that all ID’s have confidence &gt; 0.7).\n\n\nCode\nbird_scaled %&gt;%\n  mutate(confidence_lvl = cut(confidence, c(0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1), ordered_result=T)) %&gt;%\n  ggscatter(x = \"Width\", y = \"Height\", add = \"reg.line\", alpha = 0.6, color= 'confidence_lvl', size=1,\n            add.params = list(color = \"black\", fill = \"lightgray\", linetype='dashed')) +\n  stat_cor(label.x = 25, label.y = 350) +\n  stat_regline_equation(label.x = 25, label.y = 330) + \n  labs(title = 'Mid-sized birds are hard to call?',\n       colour = 'Confidence Level') + \n  theme(legend.position = 'right', legend.direction = 'vertical') +\n  scale_color_ordinal(option='D')\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that at least some of these “holes” seem to be associated with lower-confidence IDs, which is consistent with the hypothesis that they’re indicative of missing IDs from hard-to-call birds.\nIn terms of x location, distribution of bird sitting position is strikingly different at different confidence levels. High-confidence calls are much more concentrated at the sides of the feeder than the middle.\n\n\nCode\nbird_scaled %&gt;%\n  mutate(confidence_lvl = cut(confidence, c(0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1), ordered_result=T)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = xmid, fill = confidence_lvl)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + theme_pubr() + \n  labs(title = 'X position', y = 'Density', fill = 'Confidence Level')\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, it seems that those lower-confidence birds may be over-represented at the small-y (top of image) locations.\n\n\nCode\nbird_scaled %&gt;%\n  mutate(confidence_lvl = cut(confidence, c(0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1), ordered_result=T)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = ymid, fill = confidence_lvl)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + theme_pubr() + \n  labs(title = 'Y position', y = 'Density', fill = 'Confidence Level')\n\n\n\n\n\nThis corresponds to our low-confidence bird calls coming mostly from a mid-sized bounding box, and towards the back of the feeder.\n\n\nCode\np1 &lt;- bird_scaled %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=xmid, y = -ymid, color=Area)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  theme_pubr()\n\np2 &lt;- bird_scaled %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=xmid, y = -ymid, color=confidence)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) + \n  scale_colour_binned(n.breaks=3, type = \"viridis\") + \n  theme_pubr()\n\np1 | p2\n\n\n\n\n\nNotably, there are many low-confidence calls OFF the feeder.

Our hypothesis is that this has to do with avoiding the sun or hottest temperatures in the middle of the day. June was an especially hot month for 2021, and there were lots of forest fires.

These berries are edible, but quite tart - making them better suited for jams than wine.\n\n\nPhenology – biological events that depend on climate\n\nWe collected data from March to May 2021: spanning growth of inflorescence (a cluster of flowers), emergence of racemes (flower stalks), blossoming, and fruit sets.\nThis data is multimodal, and comprised of:\n\nWeather conditions\nFIT counts (flower-insect timed counts)\nVideo footage\nTime lapse images\nPollinator counts\nPollinator ID\n\n\n\nWeather\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growth of the Oregon Grape is influenced by environmental variables: shade, rain, air quality, etc. We’re using video footage and environment measures to learn about how these factors interact, and what this means for the plants and visiting pollinators!\n\n\nAir Quality\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more on different ways that we measure the air in our Air Quality Story\n\n\nFlower-insect timed (FIT) counts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      FIT Counts for April 20th-21st 2021\n    \n    \n    \n      \n      Bumble bees\n      Honey bees\n      Other bees\n      Hover flies\n      Bee flies\n      Other\n      Total\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      April 20 2021\n    \n    09:00\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n    11:00\n4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4\n    13:00\n5\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n6\n    15:40\n4\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n6\n    \n      April 21 2021\n    \n    09:00\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n    11:00\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n2\n    13:00\n3\n0\n2\n0\n0\n3\n8\n    15:40\n5\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n7\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nFIT counts provide an estimate of the proportion of pollinators seen in time lapse pictures\nDetails\n\n10 min counts of pollinators visiting at four time points during the day\nObservation area includes 48 inflorescences\n\nWeather conditions\n\nfull sun, light wind\nAM 12-13C ; PM 16-18C\n\nTotal number of pollinators over 40min of observation\n\nApr 20th n=17\nAPR 21st n=18\n\nMore pollinators in afternoon than morning\n\nApr 20th AM N=5; PM N=12\nAPR 21st AM N=3; pm n=15\n\n\n\nPollenator counts from video footage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Counts from Video Footage April 22nd 2021\n    \n    \n    \n      Time\n      Number of Pollinators\n    \n  \n  \n    10:05 - 12:00\n4\n    12:00 - 16:00\n12\n    16:00 - 20:20\n18\n    Total\n34\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nVideo footage was collected from April 21st - May 4th.

    "text": "Reading time: &lt;1 minute\nHappy St Patrick’s Day - and here’s the craic!!\nSo the weather is finally warming up here on Galiano after a chilly and stormy winter, with lots of power cuts. There was another short one this morning!!\nRichard is playing with the humming bird images and has some great pics. Here’s one of a male and female Anna’s and a male and female rufous all at the feeder at the same time - the pictures are taken at one minute intervals, so quite the shot as they usually don’t like to share!\n\n\n\nFrom left to right: rufous male; Anna’s female; rufous female; Anna’s male.\n\n\nWhile messing around in the sunshine this afternoon a big queen bumble bee flew by. First to be spotted this year! She collected nectar from the periwinkle, which seems to be invading our space but is also one of the few floral resources available right now.\nAnd here she is\n\n\n\n\n\nOther highlights this past month included peering down the microscope at a sample of a jelly fungus that appeared on the trail to Laughlin Lake, and a giant bird spotted near Pebble beach. Too far away to get a good shot, but I think maybe a Golden Eagle??\n\nJust a few more weeks before the Galiwatch pollinator monitoring starts, and lots to do before that, as I signed up for a Master melittologist program offered by Oregon State University in collaboration with the Native Bee Society of BC!! Should keep me busy as there’s a big text book that goes with it…\nBye for now\nKath :)"

    "text": "Reading time: 5 minutes\n\nAir quality management in British Columbia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBC actively monitors air quality and is part of the national Air Quality Management System (AQMS). The AQMS divides provinces into air zones that exhibit similar air quality characteristics - BC has seven air zones. Galiano is in the Georgia Straight Air Zone, which includes Victoria, Nanaimo, Comox, Campbell River, Whistler, Squamish, and Powell River.\n\n\nWeather Data & Air Pollution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir quality changes with the weather. Wind, rain, humidity and other weather parameters can all influence how air pollutants move around.\nNitrous oxides, carbon monoxide, ammonia, sulphur dioxide, methane, and carbon dioxide are polluting gases that may be emitted into the atmosphere in harmful amounts. Our enviro air quality sensors detect oxidising (e.g., NO2) and reducing gases (e.g., CO and ammonia) rather than individual gases, and can reveal trends of increasing or decreasing air quality.\nIn our setting, we are most likely to detect gaseous pollutants as a result of smoke from wood burning stoves (common in our setting) or wildfires (drifting smoke), as well as from vehicle exhaust due to proximity to roads.\n\n\nAir pollution – particulate matter (PM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPM 2.5 refers to fine airborne particles with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less. They are produced by many human activities and natural sources including vehicle exhausts, forestry operations, wood stoves, wildfires, and wind. Fine particulate matter may be harmful to health.\nPM 10 refers to all solid and liquid airborne particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less. These particles come from lots of different sources and are highly variable as a result. Many are formed by chemical or physical processes in the atmosphere. Inhaling PM 10s may also be bad for your health.\nBC’s air quality objectives reflect the maximum acceptable level of pollutants according to national air quality targets. The 24 hour average air quality objectives for PM 2.5 (24hr) and PM 10 (24hr) are 25 µg/m3 and 50 µg/m3, respectively.\n\n\nNO2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBC’s air quality objective for NO2 (primary oxidising gas detected by our sensors) is 100 parts per billion (ppb) averaged over a 1-hour period. For the two-week period from Apr 4–17, NO2 (1hr) levels measured in Victoria (Colwood City Hall) ranged from approximately 3-12 ppb, while our resistance readings ranged from approximately 10-1550 ohms. If we assume the air quality variation across the Georgia Straight air zone is representative for our site, a change in resistance of 170 ohms is equivalent to a change in NO2 of around 1 ppb.\n\n\nCO and NH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) and ammonia are reducing gases. Our enviro sensors provide a qualitative estimate of their concentration in the atmosphere with decreasing resistance measurements corresponding to decreasing air quality. Resistance readings for reducing gases and ammonia through April ranged from 90-260 Ω (around a 3-fold change), and from 90-1500 Ω (around a 16-fold change), respectively. At this time of year, wood stoves and local traffic are likely major contributors to fluctuations in air quality."
