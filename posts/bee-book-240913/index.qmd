We're pleased to announce the release of the second edition of the Galiwatch Bee Book! Brought to you by your favourite Tea Swamp members, this update marks a significant expansion of our digital resource for bee enthusiasts in British Columbia's Pacific Maritime ecozone.

What's new in this edition?

1. Expanded Species Coverage: We've added 67 new bee species to our database, incorporating recent discoveries from newly published literature and field observations.

2. Citizen Science Integration: a number of new records come directly from BC Native Bee Society Bee Atlas members, showcasing the power of community-driven research.

3. Enhanced Data Quality: We've meticulously reviewed and refined our existing records. This process involved:
   - Removing misidentified specimens
   - Eliminating species unlikely to inhabit the Pacific Maritime region
   - Excluding entries lacking solid literature support
   - Updating nomenclature to reflect the latest taxonomic revisions

4. Conservation Insights: With our expanded dataset, researchers and conservationists can gain deeper insights into local bees and their distributions.
