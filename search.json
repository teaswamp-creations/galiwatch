    "text": "Galiano is a long narrow island of the Southern Gulf Island chain situated on the western edge of the Salish Sea. Located within the coastal Douglas-fir biogeoclimatic zone, it has a semi-arid ecosystem characterized by a mild climate with cool wet winters and warm dry summers, and with annual drought conditions typically from mid-June to early October. Image adapted from Galiano Story.\nNative tree species include coast Douglas-fir, western red cedar, arbutus, western hemlock, grand fir, Garry oak, red alder, and big leaf maple. Native plants commonly found in the understory include salal, Oregon grape, sword fern, vanilla leaf, and a variety of grasses, wildflowers, mosses, and lichens. This rural island remains relatively intact ecologically.\n\n\n\n\nThe study site is situated mid island surrounded by the Mid Galiano Protected Areas Network, and within the Greig creek watershed. Cameras will be positioned to survey insect visitations to patches of salal and dull Oregon grape in proximity to a seasonally occupied log cabin. Weather data (temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity), as well as air quality and particulate matter data will be collected at the location using Raspberry Pi Enviro sensors, as well as by an independent weather station positioned close by. There are a wide variety of native and introduced flowering plants in the immediate vicinity.\n\n\n\nNative\nIntroduced\n\n\n\n\nSalal\nDaffodil\n\n\nOregon grape\nHelebore\n\n\nRock stonecrop\nHeather\n\n\nWild strawberry\nWooly mint\n\n\nClover\nSage\n\n\nVetch\nOregano\n\n\nTrailing blackberry\nLavender\n\n\nWestern star flower\nMarjoram\n\n\nRed-flowering currant\nCranesbill\n\n\nHoneysuckle\nRose campion\n\n\nMiners Lettuce\nCutleaf blackberry\n\n\nCreeping Thistle\nPeriwinkle\n\n\nCommon Catsear\nDandelion\n\n\nThimbleberry\nDaisy and oxeye daisy\n\n\n-\nScotch broom\n\n\n-\nHimalayan blackberry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProximate habitat within about a 1/2 km radius includes bare bedrock, light well-draining sandy soil interspersed with clay deposits, and soil with high organic content from fallen trees and branches. Urbanisation includes several other nearby properties, some seasonal, others occupied year-round, which are serviced by paved roads, as well as about an acre of productive farmland (flowering crops include sunflowers, peas, beans, potatoes, basil, and artichokes, etc). There are two man-made ponds as well as areas of wetland and rough pasture."

They measure changes in concentrations of reducing (e.g., carbon monoxide) and oxidising (e.g., nitrogen dioxide) gases, and ammonia. The sensors measure electrical resistance according to the concentration of gases in the air. The resistance readings for reducing gases and ammonia drop with increasing concentrations of these gases, and increase when oxidising gases increase.\nThe particulate matter sensor detects concentrations of particles of different sizes (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10) as well as the number of particles of different sizes (&gt;0.3, &gt;0.5, &gt;1.0, &gt;2.5, &gt;5, and &gt;10 microns). Wildfire smoke particles typically range from 0.4–0.7 microns, dust is around 2.5 microns, while pollen is generally 15 microns or more.\n\n\n\n\nAdapted from Jisaac9, Mieszko the first, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Reading time: 3 minutes\n\nSmokey air exchange\nThe air INSIDE our building changes more slowly than the air OUTSIDE. Last night there was a lot of smoke in the air until the afternoon, when it became very windy and the smoke was replaced with clean air from the north, such that the PM2.5s outside went from above 20 down to 1-2 in about 10 minutes. Let’s call this “almost instantly” (see Figure 1, blue line).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Indoor/outdoor air exchange\n\n\n\n\nThe PM2.5s inside the building then dropped in a nicely exponential fashion (gold line in Figure 1 above, or the blue line plotted on a log scale to the right), allowing us to estimate the half-time for replacement of the indoor air (Figure 2). The slope is -.0012, so the half-time for the replacement of the air inside the building was 577 minutes, or around 9.5 hours.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Indoor air replacement half-life estimation\n\n\nThis seemed surprisingly FAST(!) since all the doors and windows were closed and there was no one at the building and no ventilation. However, the EPA standards for building ventilation recommend 0.35 air changes per hour for residential buildings, or turnover every three hours. However, that is for places with active air exchange, rather than just leaky doors, windows and walls. This air turnover rate of ~9.5 hours is for when it is VERY WINDY, and probably the actual turnover on normal days is quite a bit less.\nAssuming air exchange with a half-life around 10 hours also lets us create a model (red line in figure Figure 4) of both the actual indoor PM2.5 and the temperatures as a function of the outdoor values. Actual indoor values are shown in orange and outdoor in blue. Over a larger timeframe of three days (4500 minutes), the fit of the PM2.5 is not great (see Figure 4, middle panel), suggesting that the wind-assisted value we calculated might have been a bit too fast for when it is not windy (which started around at the 3000 minute mark).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Models of air exchange with different half-lifes. Note: Blue lines are actual outdoor PM2.5, orange lines are actual indoor PM2.5\n\n\nHowever, this is much better than an indoor PM2.5 model assuming exchange of 1 hour (the indoors would look like the outdoors) or 100 hours (indoor would be almost independent of outdoor), so we are in the right order of magnitude.\n\n\nTemperature\nAs another “reality check” we can also make the same simple exponential model of indoor temperature as function of outdoor temperature. Once again, assuming a half-life of around 10 hours gives us a reasonable reflection of the outdoor value, whereas the 1 hour and 100 hour half-lives are plainly unreasonable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Models of temperature change with different half-lifes. Note: Blue lines are actual outdoor temperature, orange lines are actual indoor temperature.\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nUsing an estimated air exchange of 10 hours gives reasonable approximations of indoor PM2.5 and temperature, suggesting that air exchange is driving both, which makes sense. Probably we have discovered the value of insulation."

It first appears in the records in the 1950s when a few specimens were found in the interior of BC, and there was talk of it being assigned threatened or endangered status. By 2000 however, it had expanded through the Okanagan and Similkameen valleys, as well as having become firmly established in the Pacific Maritime region 2."

    "text": "Reading time: 3 minutes\nWild pollinators are an integral part of native plant communities and are highly effective at pollinating flowers in natural ecosystems. Plant pollination is essential for plant reproduction, which in turn provides fruits and seeds for wildlife. Abundance and diversity of pollinators ensure a stable, highly productive ecosystem.\nChanging environmental conditions caused by weather, climate change, or human interventions, may disrupt pollinator activity for some species but enhance it for others. Within natural ecosystems, biodiversity and abundance of wild bee populations and other non-bee pollinators provides redundancy that ensures ongoing pollination and plant productivity despite a changing environment.\nManaged pollinators, most commonly honey bees, are super-generalist pollinators that are essential for, or enhance, the pollination and production of many agricultural crops. We rely heavily on honey bees for certain types of food production - for example they are considered essential to sustaining the global supply of almonds - and support billions of dollars worth of food production worldwide. So, it is very worrying that beekeepers report honeybee populations are dwindling, and that their colonies are becoming increasingly vulnerable to environmental stressors.\nAlongside honey bees, wild pollinators including bumble bees (genus Bombus), other types of bees, wasps, and other non-bee species also make important contributions to crop production. Interestingly, on organic farms near natural habitat, wild bees can provide full pollinator services and, as long as diversity is maintained, there is sustained success.1\nIt seems possible then that by making adjustments that favour abundance and diversity of wild pollinators we could build capacity and resilience within natural and agricultural ecosystems that offset shortfalls in managed pollinator services resulting from the ongoing, perplexing losses of managed colonies."

In addition to monitoring trends in air quality, the particulate matter sensor should give us an estimate of pollen count and detect smoke from wildfire drift.\nAs well as piloting the technology, these observations will be a window to the day-to-day ins and outs of Galiano pollinators that will help us better understand how wildflowers and pollinators are affected by local weather events."

We picked up evidence of the fires from our monitoring site - here’s a brief summary of what we saw.\nWe’ll read in our data: air quality measures from our Purple Air sensor\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\n# read in air quality data, and prepare variable names\nair &lt;- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaswamp-creations/galiwatch.ca/quarto-website/posts/fires-220223/2021_temp_and_PM.csv') %&gt;%\n  mutate(`Row Labels` = as_date(ymd_hms(`Row Labels`))) %&gt;%\n  rename(Date = `Row Labels`,\n         PM1.0 = `Average of PM1.0_CF1_ug/m3`,\n         PM2.5 = `Average of PM2.5_CF1_ug/m3`,\n         PM10.0 = `Average of PM10.0_CF1_ug/m3`,\n        `Temp C` = `Average of Temperature_F`)\n\n\nLooking at the air quality data, we notice a few things. Firstly, all the PM values have peaks in the same places, and they don’t seem too well-correlated with the outdoor temperature.\n\n\nCode\nair %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(c(PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10.0, `Temp C`)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(name = ordered(name, levels = c('PM1.0', 'PM2.5', 'PM10.0', 'Temp C'))) %&gt;%\n  group_by(name) %&gt;%\n  mutate(rollmean = zoo::rollmean(value, 10, align = 'right', fill=NA)) %&gt;%\n  ggline(x = 'Date', y = 'rollmean', color='name', plot_type='l', size=1, alpha = 0.8) + \n  labs(title = 'Air Quality Measures in Summer 2021',\n       subtitle = 'Rolling 10-day average', \n       y='Value', color = 'Measure') + \n  scale_colour_manual(values = c('lightblue', 'orange', 'salmon', 'grey')) + \n  theme(legend.position = 'right')\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t all that surprising, and we can see the correlation is very close to 1 for the different PM sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPicking just PM2.5, we can remake the first plot, this time showing the daily average, without the 10-day smoothing we used before. This gives us a more granular view of air quality events.\n\n\nCode\nair %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(c(PM2.5, `Temp C`)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(name) %&gt;%\n  ggline(x = 'Date', y = 'value', color='name', plot_type='l', size=1, alpha = 0.8) + \n  labs(title = 'Forest Fires cause Temperature and PM2.5 to spike',\n       y='Value', color = 'Measure') + \n  scale_colour_manual(values = c('orange', 'grey')) + \n  theme(legend.position = 'right') + \n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%b\", date_breaks = \"1 month\") + \n  \n  geom_label(aes(x = ymd('2021-05-15'), y = 30, label = \"June heatdome\"), \n               hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5, label.size = NA, size=3.5, family='xkcd') +\n  geom_curve(aes(x = ymd('2021-05-15'), y = 32, xend = ymd('2021-06-20'), yend = 40), \n             colour = \"#555555\", curvature = -0.3, size=0.8)+  \n  geom_label(aes(x = ymd('2021-06-15'), y = 55, label = \"Air quality advisory\\nissued for metro Vancouver\"), \n             hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5, label.size = NA, size=3.5, family='xkcd')+ \n  geom_curve(aes(x = ymd('2021-06-15'), y = 51, xend = ymd('2021-08-10'), yend = 45), \n             colour = \"#555555\", curvature = 0.25, size=0.8)+ \n  geom_label(aes(x = ymd('2021-11-05'), y = 45, label = \"Likely woodsmoke from\\nlocal fireplaces\"), \n             hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5, label.size = NA, size=3.5, family='xkcd')+\n  geom_bracket(xmin = ymd('2021-09-15'), xmax = ymd('2021-12-30'), y.position = 40, label='', size=0.8, tip.length = 0.02)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can clearly see the peak in temperature when BC got hit by the heatdome. We hypothesize that winter spikes in PM2.5 happen when nearby houses burn wood in their fireplace for heating, as they seem to be associated with relative dips in temperature."

    "section": "Preliminaries",
    "text": "Preliminaries\n\nNumber of birds by species\nOur bird detector ID’d lots of visitors! Each ID represents a bird captured in an image, and not necessarily an individual. The images are captured once every minute, so if for example a single bird sat at the feeder for two minutes in a row, it would get counted twice. There may be multiple birds in a single image.\n\n\nCode\nbird %&gt;%\n  group_by(Species, Sex) %&gt;%\n  summarise('Number of ids' = n(), .groups = 'keep') %&gt;%\n  kableExtra::kbl() %&gt;%\n  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nSex\nNumber of ids\n\n\n\n\nAnnas\nFemale\n4127\n\n\nAnnas\nMale\n1792\n\n\nRufous\nFemale\n11720\n\n\nRufous\nMale\n1081\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassifier confidence\nEach bird ID is made by picking the the most likely label, based on the prediction probability. Sometimes, the classifier isn’t as confident as others. For example, it may be harder to identify a bird that is facing away from the camera. We can plot the confidences, and see which birds are the hardest to label.\n\n\nCode\nbird %&gt;%\n  gghistogram(x = 'confidence', fill = 'Species', color='Species', bins=100,\n              facet.by = 'Sex', scales = 'free_y', alpha=1, position='stack') +\n  labs(title = 'Prediction for females may be better calibrated',\n       subtitle = 'Higher proportion of low-confidence IDs for males vs females of both species', \n       x = 'Prediction confidence', y = 'Number of IDs') + \n  theme(legend.position = 'right') + \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c('chartreuse3', 'chocolate2')) + \n  scale_colour_manual(values=c('chartreuse3', 'chocolate2'))\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like for both species, Male birds are slightly harder to identify with high confidence than Female. This might be explained by the fact that there are many more Female examples than Male in our data.\nThere is almost certainly some mistakes in our classifier, including false positives (non-birds labeled as birds) and false negatives (birds that are missed)\nTo help make sure we’re only considering high-quality calls, we’ll pick a confidence threshold of 0.7 and only analyse the IDs above that level.\n\n\nNumber of birds after filtering\nWe manually looked at the images, and found that that almost all the Rufouses after September 1st are false positives, so we’ll remove these observations. Also, since we have very few IDs in October, we will drop this month from our data. Then, we’ll filter to only retain the high-confidence (&gt; 0.7 prediction probability) bird IDs\n\n\nCode\nbird &lt;- bird %&gt;%\n  filter(!(Timestamp &gt;= ymd('2021-09-01') & Species =='Rufous')) %&gt;%\n  filter(Timestamp &lt; ymd('2021-10-01')) %&gt;%\n  filter(confidence &gt; 0.7)\n\n\nLastly, we’ll sanity check the bounding boxes for their size.\n\n\nCode\nbird &lt;- bird %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Height = ymax-ymin, \n    Width = xmax-xmin, \n    Area = Height * Width\n    \n  )\n\nbird %&gt;% \n  gghistogram(x=\"Area\", bins = 100) + \n  labs(title = 'There are some very small and some very large bounding boxes.',\n       subtitle = \"Note also relative raity of areas at 25,000 and 50,000 pixels\", y = 'Count')\n\n\n\n\n\nThis distribution more or less makes sense, we see some very small bounding boxes which may be mis-calls or birds who are only half in the image. There are also some cases where a bird is partially obscured because it’s sitting behind the feeder. There are some very large bounding boxes also. I’m not sure exactly whether these are real, giant humming birds, or some kind of artifact. We’ll drop the smallest and largest 1% of bounding boxes just in case.\n\n\nCode\nbird &lt;- bird %&gt;% \n  filter(Area &gt; quantile(bird$Area, 0.01) & Area &lt; quantile(bird$Area, 0.99)) \n\n\nNote that because of the camera perspective, bounding box area will be affected by not only the bird size, but also its closeness to the camera.\nThe dips we see around 25,000 and 50,000 bounding box size are surprizing, this means that there are certain height/width combinations that are not being picked up very frequently. This may indicate that there are certain positions on the feeder at which we can’t effectively identify birds.\nWe see this even more clearly by plotting bird height against width.\n\n\nCode\nbird %&gt;%\n  ggscatter(x = \"Width\", y = \"Height\", add = \"reg.line\", alpha = 0.2, \n            add.params = list(color = \"black\", fill = \"lightgray\")) +\n  stat_cor(label.x = 25, label.y = 400) +\n  stat_regline_equation(label.x = 25, label.y = 380) + \n  labs(title = 'Some height/width combinations are missing')\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s some height/widths with no birds observed at them! To check whether this may be related to out classifier’s ability to call these birds, we can colour this plot by the confidence level (recall: we already filtered the data such that all ID’s have confidence &gt; 0.7).\n\n\nCode\nbird %&gt;%\n  mutate(confidence_lvl = cut(confidence, c(0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1), ordered_result=T)) %&gt;%\n  ggscatter(x = \"Width\", y = \"Height\", add = \"reg.line\", alpha = 0.4, color= 'confidence_lvl',\n            add.params = list(color = \"black\", fill = \"lightgray\", linetype='dashed')) +\n  stat_cor(label.x = 25, label.y = 400) +\n  stat_regline_equation(label.x = 25, label.y = 380) + \n  labs(title = 'Missing height/widths may be caused to hard-to call birds',\n       colour = 'Confidence Level') \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that at least some of these “holes” seem to be associated with lower-confidence IDs, which is consistent with the hypothesis that they’re indicative of missing IDs from hard-to-call birds.\nHere’s how many IDs we’re left with after that data cleaning:\n\n\nCode\nbird %&gt;%\n  group_by(Species, Sex) %&gt;%\n  summarise('Number of IDs' = n(), .groups = 'keep') %&gt;%\n  kableExtra::kbl() %&gt;%\n  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies\nSex\nNumber of IDs\n\n\n\n\nAnnas\nFemale\n2949\n\n\nAnnas\nMale\n843\n\n\nRufous\nFemale\n9745\n\n\nRufous\nMale\n650"

    "text": "Visiting Hours\nWe thought the hours of the day in which birds visit the feeder might give interesting insight into their behaviour. After poking around in te data, we found that visiting hours vary widely from month-to-month. In both species, we see a big dip in visits from 12-3pm in June. Our hypothesis is that this has to do with avoiding the sun or hottest temperatures in the middle of the day. June was an especially hot month for 2021, and there were lots of forest fires. However, it’s somewhat surprising to not also see this effect in July and August, which are generally similar to June in terms of weather.\n\n\nCode\nbird %&gt;%\n  filter(Species == 'Rufous') %&gt;%\n  filter(Date &lt; ymd('2021-08-01')) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(x=Hour, fill = Sex)) + \n  geom_bar(position = 'stack') + facet_wrap(\"~Month\", scales='free_y') +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c('chocolate1', 'chocolate4')) + \n  labs(title='Rufous visit times vary by month', y = 'Number of IDs') + \n  theme_pubr()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbird %&gt;%\n  filter(Species == 'Annas') %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=Hour, fill = Sex)) + \n  geom_bar(position='stack') + facet_wrap(\"~Month\", scales='free_y') + \n  scale_fill_manual(values=c('chartreuse1', 'chartreuse4')) + \n  labs(title='Annas visit times vary by month', y = 'Number of IDs') + \n  theme_pubr()"

There was another short one this morning!!\nRichard is playing with the humming bird images and has some great pics. Here’s one of a male and female Anna’s and a male and female rufous all at the feeder at the same time - the pictures are taken at one minute intervals, so quite the shot as they usually don’t like to share!\n\n\n\nFrom left to right: rufous male; Anna’s female; rufous female; Anna’s male.\n\n\nWhile messing around in the sunshine this afternoon a big queen bumble bee flew by. First to be spotted this year! She collected nectar from the periwinkle, which seems to be invading our space but is also one of the few floral resources available right now.\nAnd here she is\n\n\n\n\n\nOther highlights this past month included peering down the microscope at a sample of a jelly fungus that appeared on the trail to Laughlin Lake, and a giant bird spotted near Pebble beach. Too far away to get a good shot, but I think maybe a Golden Eagle??\n\nJust a few more weeks before the Galiwatch pollinator monitoring starts, and lots to do before that, as I signed up for a Master melittologist program offered by Oregon State University in collaboration with the Native Bee Society of BC!! Should keep me busy as there’s a big text book that goes with it…\nBye for now\nKath :)"

    "text": "Reading time: 5 minutes\n\nAir quality management in British Columbia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBC actively monitors air quality and is part of the national Air Quality Management System (AQMS). The AQMS divides provinces into air zones that exhibit similar air quality characteristics - BC has seven air zones. Galiano is in the Georgia Straight Air Zone, which includes Victoria, Nanaimo, Comox, Campbell River, Whistler, Squamish, and Powell River.\n\n\nWeather Data & Air Pollution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir quality changes with the weather. Wind, rain, humidity and other weather parameters can all influence how air pollutants move around.\nNitrous oxides, carbon monoxide, ammonia, sulphur dioxide, methane, and carbon dioxide are polluting gases that may be emitted into the atmosphere in harmful amounts. Our enviro air quality sensors detect oxidising (e.g., NO2) and reducing gases (e.g., CO and ammonia) rather than individual gases, and can reveal trends of increasing or decreasing air quality.\nIn our setting, we are most likely to detect gaseous pollutants as a result of smoke from wood burning stoves (common in our setting) or wildfires (drifting smoke), as well as from vehicle exhaust due to proximity to roads.\n\n\nAir pollution – particulate matter (PM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPM 2.5 refers to fine airborne particles with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less. They are produced by many human activities and natural sources including vehicle exhausts, forestry operations, wood stoves, wildfires, and wind. Fine particulate matter may be harmful to health.\nPM 10 refers to all solid and liquid airborne particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less. These particles come from lots of different sources and are highly variable as a result. Many are formed by chemical or physical processes in the atmosphere. Inhaling PM 10s may also be bad for your health.\nBC’s air quality objectives reflect the maximum acceptable level of pollutants according to national air quality targets. The 24 hour average air quality objectives for PM 2.5 (24hr) and PM 10 (24hr) are 25 µg/m3 and 50 µg/m3, respectively.\n\n\nNO2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBC’s air quality objective for NO2 (primary oxidising gas detected by our sensors) is 100 parts per billion (ppb) averaged over a 1-hour period. For the two-week period from Apr 4–17, NO2 (1hr) levels measured in Victoria (Colwood City Hall) ranged from approximately 3-12 ppb, while our resistance readings ranged from approximately 10-1550 ohms. If we assume the air quality variation across the Georgia Straight air zone is representative for our site, a change in resistance of 170 ohms is equivalent to a change in NO2 of around 1 ppb.\n\n\nCO and NH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO) and ammonia are reducing gases. Our enviro sensors provide a qualitative estimate of their concentration in the atmosphere with decreasing resistance measurements corresponding to decreasing air quality. Resistance readings for reducing gases and ammonia through April ranged from 90-260 Ω (around a 3-fold change), and from 90-1500 Ω (around a 16-fold change), respectively. At this time of year, wood stoves and local traffic are likely major contributors to fluctuations in air quality."
