In addition to monitoring trends in air quality, the particulate matter sensor should give us an estimate of pollen count and detect smoke from wildfire drift.\nAs well as piloting the technology, these observations will be a window to the day-to-day ins and outs of Galiano pollinators that will help us better understand how wildflowers and pollinators are affected by local weather events."

    "text": "Wild pollinators are an integral part of native plant communities and are highly effective at pollinating flowers in natural ecosystems. Plant pollination is essential for plant reproduction, which in turn provides fruits and seeds for wildlife. Abundance and diversity of pollinators ensure a stable, highly productive ecosystem.\nChanging environmental conditions caused by weather, climate change, or human interventions, may disrupt pollinator activity for some species but enhance it for others. Within natural ecosystems, biodiversity and abundance of wild bee populations and other non-bee pollinators provides redundancy that ensures ongoing pollination and plant productivity despite a changing environment.\nManaged pollinators, most commonly honey bees, are super-generalist pollinators that are essential for, or enhance, the pollination and production of many agricultural crops. We rely heavily on honey bees for certain types of food production - for example they are considered essential to sustaining the global supply of almonds - and support billions of dollars worth of food production worldwide. So, it is very worrying that beekeepers report honeybee populations are dwindling, and that their colonies are becoming increasingly vulnerable to environmental stressors.\n\n\n\nAdapted from: 2019-2020 Honey Bee Colony Losses in the United States: Preliminary Results. Accessed April 12, 2021\n\n\nAlongside honey bees, wild pollinators including bumble bees (genus Bombus), other types of bees, wasps, and other non-bee species also make important contributions to crop production. Interestingly, on organic farms near natural habitat, wild bees can provide full pollinator services and, as long as diversity is maintained, there is sustained success.1\nIt seems possible then that by making adjustments that favour abundance and diversity of wild pollinators we could build capacity and resilience within natural and agricultural ecosystems that offset shortfalls in managed pollinator services resulting from the ongoing, perplexing losses of managed colonies.\n\nBumble bee species in flux in British Columbia\n Decline of bumble bees has been reported in North America and Europe and is of significant global concern.2 Although there are over 500 known bee species in British Columbia, there is not a lot of historical information about pollinator populations to use as a baseline. However, we do know that at least one bee species, the western bumble bee, B. occidentalis, has significantly declined.3 The authors discuss how this bee used to be very common in the lower mainland in the 1980s, representing 25-30% of bumble bee species collected on local berry farms, but by 2003/2004 had dwindled to less than 1% of the bees collected. Since then, B. occidentalis was sighted just a handful of times on Vancouver Island in 2012, and once in the lower mainland at Boundary Bay in 2013. According to a local newspaper report, it was last spotted on Galiano in 1990. In contrast however, it seems the yellow-faced bumble bee, B. vosnesenskii, may be gaining ground in the region.4\nGaliano’s bumble bees have recently been under scrutiny in a study to better understand their reliance on habitat diversity in this semi-arid ecosystem 5. The author identified six species of bumble bees that frequented flowering shrubs in various habitats through spring and summer, and saw fluctuations of bumble bee abundance in different habitats (wet, dry, modified, natural) as the summer progressed. Overall, the Vancouver bumble bee B. vancouverensis was the most abundant species, followed by the Sitka bumble bee B. sitkensis, while the yellow-faced bumble bee B. vosnesenskii was least abundant, perhaps reflecting it has only recently made it to the island. Bumble bee activity and blooming peaked in June in habitat similar to our study site, but even as flowering slowed high numbers of bumble bees were found to persist through July.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nKremen C, Williams NM, Thorp RW.

    "text": "Air quality monitoring\nThe air quality monitoring sensors will give us an idea of how air quality changes over time. They measure changes in concentrations of reducing (e.g., carbon monoxide) and oxidising (e.g., nitrogen dioxide) gases, and ammonia. The sensors measure electrical resistance according to the concentration of gases in the air. The resistance readings for reducing gases and ammonia drop with increasing concentrations of these gases, and increase when oxidising gases increase.\nThe particulate matter sensor detects concentrations of particles of different sizes (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10) as well as the number of particles of different sizes (>0.3, >0.5, >1.0, >2.5, >5, and >10 microns). Wildfire smoke particles typically range from 0.4–0.7 microns, dust is around 2.5 microns, while pollen is generally 15 microns or more.\n\n\n\n\nAdapted from Jisaac9, Mieszko the first, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons"

Our reference resource for insect identification is the Biodiversity Galiano project, a community-based initiative to document the flora and fauna of Galiano Island, initiated in January 2016. So far, over 2,500 species have been reported of which more than 1,000 are arthropods. Among these are 82 species of bees and wasps including honey bees (Apis mellifera), bumblebees (Bombus spp.) mining bees (Andrena spp.), long-horned bees (Eucera spp.), mason bees (Osmia spp.), cuckoo bees (Nomada spp.), sweat bees (Halictus and Lasioglossum spp.), blood bees (Sphecodes spp.), and various wasps.\nWe will use this database to help ID any pollinators we see in our time-lapse images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith systems up and running we hope to collect data from late March to early September including:\n\nImages of Salal and Dull Oregon grape from bud burst to fruit maturation.\n\nImages of pollinators showing when and how often they come to visit, and enabling identification of different species.\nDay-to-day weather data, including high and low temperatures, pressure, humidity (Raspberry pi and Acurite), wind speed and direction, total rainfall, UV and light intensity (Acurite only). This will enable comparison of the two systems, and establish reproducibility of the instruments.\nClimate data including average, maximum and minimum temperatures; light intensity; pressure; wind speed, and total rainfall accumulation.\nEstimates of reducing and oxidising gases, and ammonia representing trends of increasing or decreasing air quality, and estimates of particulates, such as dust, pollen, mould spores, smoke etc.\n\nIn addition to piloting the technology, the images and weather data will provide baseline information about our test site including:\n\nDate of bud burst and duration of flowering of salal and dull Oregon grape.\nPollinator community composition visiting these plants during the flowering season (bees, hoverflies, butterflies, moths, wasps, other flies, beetles, hummingbirds).\nTime of first appearance and seasonal dynamics of different pollinators.\nHow much of a role, if any, non-bee visitors play in the pollination of these two native plants.\nHow hyperlocal weather and variations in air quality influence pollinator activity.\n\nThe images and weather data will add to what is already known about pollinators in coastal Douglas-fir ecosystems on the west coast of British Columbia and provide additional information about pollinator behaviour both throughout the day and day-to-day while plants are in bloom."
