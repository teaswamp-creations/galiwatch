# Series Part 3

This is the second post in this deep-dive series.  
You can start from the beginning with [Part 1](https://galiwatch.ca/posts/hummer-data-cleaning-170323), or skip forward to [Part 4]()
:::

## Setup

As previously covered in part i, we're looking at the hummingbird detection data from 2021. We did some preliminary data exploration, and saw some interesting patterns in the visit times of different birds.

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(patchwork)
library(ggpubr)

# classifier labels
classes = c('Rufous_Male', 'Annas_Male', 'Person_', 'Annas_Female', 'Rufous_Female')

# read in bird detection data, and do some basic data cleaning
bird <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaswamp-creations/galiwatch.ca/quarto-website/posts/hummer-behaviour-170323/2021_reprocessed_hummers_combo_2023.csv') %>% 
  # lookup labels
  mutate(class = classes[label + 1]) %>%
  # put columns into tidy format
  separate(class, into=c('Species', 'Sex'), sep='_') %>%
  separate(image, into=c('Date', 'image'), sep="_", remove = F) %>%
  separate(image, into=c('hhmm'), sep=".jpg", extra = 'drop') %>%
  # clean up timestamps
  mutate(Timestamp = ymd_hm(paste(Date, hhmm))) %>%
  # remove people
  filter(label != 2) %>%
  # change column types, correct for variable image size
  mutate(Date=ymd(Date),
         Month=factor(month(Date, label = T)),
         Hour=hour(Timestamp),
         Species = ordered(Species),
         Sex = factor(Sex),
         MergeTime = floor_date(Timestamp, 'hour'),
         xmid = (xmax+xmin)/2, 
         ymid = (ymax+ymin)/2
  ) 

```

## Distribution of sitting spots

We can plot the location of where each bird sits, with the proxy that a birds will be located at the center of its bounding box. The birds appear to mostly sit in a circle, around the rim of the feeder. This makes sense, as it gives the best access to the sugar water.

```{r}
bird %>% 
  ggscatter(x='xmid', y='ymid', alpha=0.4, color ='y_size')
```

However, it looks like there are at least 2 distinct positions that the feeder was in over the summer. We'll try to do batch correction for this, by assigning a batch number to each position, and subtract the average from the x and y direction. I think we can reasonably split the changes in position (the batches) simply by the date. This is easy to see in the ymid variable - the feeder moves twice in May, and once in June.

```{r}
bird %>% 
  mutate(Month = month(Date, label=T)) %>%
  filter(Date>'2021-05-01' & Date<'2021-06-15') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Timestamp, y = ymid))+ 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_wrap("~Month", scales = 'free_x') + 
  theme_pubr() + 
  labs(title = 'Feeder Moves Up and Down in May and June')
```

Lets split these into batches for correction.

```{r batching}
bird$batch <- 1
bird$batch <- ifelse(bird$Timestamp > ymd_hms('2021-05-08 00:00:00'),2,bird$batch)
bird$batch <- ifelse(bird$Timestamp > ymd_hms('2021-05-11 00:00:00'),3,bird$batch)
bird$batch <- ifelse(bird$Timestamp > ymd_hms('2021-06-13 12:20:00'),4,bird$batch)
bird$batch <- factor(bird$batch)
```

We can check it went as expected by recolouring the previous plot by batch

```{r}
bird %>% 
  mutate(Month = month(Date, label=T)) %>%
  mutate(xmid = (xmax+xmin)/2, ymid = (ymax+ymin)/2) %>% 
  filter(Date>'2021-05-01' & Date<'2021-06-15') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Timestamp, y = ymid, color=batch))+ 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_wrap("~Month", scales = 'free_x') + 
  theme_pubr() + 
  labs(title = 'We can Infer Position Batches Based on When the Feeder Moves',
       colour = 'Batch')
```

Now we're ready to correct! We'll transform all the x- and y- values by centering and scaling each batch. This will yield a new positioning relative to the middle of the feeder; we can no longer interpret this as the pixel index in the image.

```{r}
bird_scaled <- bird %>% 
  mutate(Month = month(Date, label=T)) %>%
  group_by(batch) %>%
  mutate(ymin1 = ymax, ymax1=ymin) %>%
  mutate(across(c(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax), ~ scale(.x)) ) %>%
  mutate(xmid = (xmax+xmin)/2, ymid = (ymax+ymin)/2)


bird_scaled %>% 
  filter(Date>'2021-05-01' & Date<'2021-06-15') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Timestamp, y = ymid, color=batch))+ 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_wrap("~Month", scales = 'free_x') + 
  theme_pubr() + 
  labs(title = 'Batch corrected for feeder position',
       colour = 'Batch')
```

We can see that the correction didn't perfectly fix things - but it looks pretty good!

```{r}
p1 <- bird %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=xmid, y=ymid) ) +
  stat_density_2d(aes(fill=batch), geom = "polygon", alpha=0.2) + 
  theme_pubr() + 
  labs(title = 'Bird density before batch correction', fill = 'Batch')

p2 <- bird_scaled %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=xmid, y=ymid) ) +
  stat_density_2d(aes(fill=batch), geom = "polygon", alpha=0.2) + 
  theme_pubr() + 
  labs(title = 'Bird density after batch correction',fill = 'Batch')

p1 | p2

```




The gap in the middle comes from the water column - we can't detect birds sitting behind it! Of course, we have to be somewhat careful when converting back to the coordinates of the image. I negate the y coordinates, because they count from the top of the image. 

```{r, eval=T, warning=F}
img <- jpeg::readJPEG('feeder.jpg')

bird_scaled %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=xmid, y = -ymid)) + 
  ylim(-1.8,8) + xlim(-1.8, 1.8) +
  background_image(img) + 
  geom_point(shape = 'x') 

```

## Bird size!

Now that we have our corrected bounding boxes, we can have a look at bird sizes!

Going back to the same height/width plot we saw last time, the "holes" are nearly gone, but the mid-sized birds are the hardest to classify with high certainty.

```{r, warning=F}
bird_scaled <- bird_scaled %>%
  mutate(
    Height = ymax-ymin, 
    Width = xmax-xmin, 
    Area = abs(Height * Width)) %>%
  mutate(confidence_lvl = cut(confidence, c(0, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1), ordered_result=T)) 

bird_scaled %>%
  ggscatter(x = "Width", y = "Height", add = "reg.line", alpha = 0.2, color= 'confidence_lvl',
            add.params = list(color = "black", fill = "lightgray", linetype='dashed')) +
  #stat_cor(label.x = .25, label.y = 450) +
  #stat_regline_equation(label.x = .25, label.y = 400) + 
  labs(title = 'Mid-sized birds are hard-to call?',
       colour = 'Confidence Level') 


bird %>%
  mutate(
    Height = ymax-ymin, 
    Width = xmax-xmin, 
    Area = abs(Height * Width)) %>%
  mutate(confidence_lvl = cut(confidence, c(0, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1), ordered_result=T))%>%
  ggscatter(y = "Area", x = "confidence", add = "reg.line", alpha = 0.2,
            add.params = list(color = "black", fill = "lightgray", linetype='dashed'))
```


Our low-confidence bird calls seem to be concentrated to a mid-sized bounding box, and towards the back of the feeder. 

```{r}
p1 <- bird_scaled %>% 
  mutate(area_lvl = cut(Area, c(0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1), ordered_result=T, include.lowest = T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=xmid, y = ymid, color=area_lvl)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  theme_pubr() + theme(legend.position = 'none')

p2 <- bird_scaled %>% 
  mutate(confidence_lvl = cut(confidence, c(0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1), ordered_result=T)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=xmid, y = ymid, color=confidence_lvl)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  theme_pubr() + theme(legend.position = 'none')


p1 | p2
```

```{r, eval=F}
bird <- bird %>% 
  mutate(
         xmid = (xmax+xmin)/2, 
         ymid = (ymax+ymin)/2,
         Width = xmax - xmin, 
         Height = ymax - ymin
  )


bird %>%mutate(xmid = (xmax+xmin)/2, ymid = (ymax+ymin)/2) %>%
  ggscatter(x='xmid', y='Area', color ='ymid') + 
  facet_wrap(~Species)
```

Although Annas are generally larger than Rufous humming birds, we have to keep in mind the camera position. Birds in the middle of the feeder will likely result in bounding boxes that are taller, while birds on the sides may have a wider "profile view" bounding box:

![](feeder_view.png)

```{r, eval=T}

# how to make circle plot: pick center of box, plot x/y
# most interested in feet: on the left - feet are on the left. 
# if you're on the right, your feet are on the right. Could probably pick the center

# change female -> female + immature male

bird_scaled %>% 
  mutate(xmid = (xmax+xmin)/2, ymid = (ymax+ymin)/2) %>%
  mutate(Width = xmax - xmin, Height = ymax - ymin) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x=xmid, y = Width, xmax, colour = Sex) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_wrap(~Species) +
  labs(title = 'Birds are wider on the sides of the feeder', subtitle = '(profile view?)')

bird_scaled %>% 
  mutate(xmid = (xmax+xmin)/2, ymid = (ymax+ymin)/2) %>%
  mutate(Width = xmax - xmin, Height = ymax - ymin) %>%
  ggplot(alpha = 0.5) + 
  aes(x=xmid, y = Height, xmax, colour = Sex) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~Species) +
  labs(title = 'Annas are taller (and don\'t get ID\'d sitting middle)')


bird_scaled %>% 
  mutate(xmid = (xmax+xmin)/2, ymid = (ymax+ymin)/2) %>%
  mutate(Width = xmax - xmin, Height = ymax - ymin) %>%
  ggplot(alpha = 0.5) + 
  aes(x=xmid, y = ymid, xmax, colour = Sex) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~Species) +
  labs(title = 'Birds mostly sit on the feeder', subtitle = "Annas are sometimes ID\'d in flight")

```

# Species comparison

We should keep in mind the camera position: birds in the middle of the feeder will likely result in bounding boxes that are taller, while birds on the sides may have a wider "profile view" bounding box:




![](feeder_view.png)

Assuming that preferred sitting position is independent of bird species and sex, we can compare directly the bounding boxes of the different classes. Annas are generally larger than Rufous humming birds, and for each species, the males are smaller than the females. 

```{r}
bird_scaled %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Sex, y=Height, fill=Species)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_pubr() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c('chartreuse3', 'chocolate2')) +
  stat_compare_means(method = 't.test', label.y = c(350,350))


```

However, it's this may be an imperfect assumption: 

```{r}
bird_scaled %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = xmid, y=-ymid, colour = Species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_colour_manual(values=c('chartreuse3', 'chocolate2')) +
  facet_wrap(~Sex) + 
  theme_pubr() + 
  labs(title = 'Annas are not identified in the middle as often as Rufous')

```

Annas aren't identified in the middle as often as Rufouses are. This could be be because they don't sit there as often, but more likely they're just chanllenging to identify when they're facing away from the camera.

## Migration patterns

The Anna and Rufous hummingbirds have two quite distinct migration patterns: Annas are year-round visitors to our feeder in BC, while the Rufouses tend to leave for Mexico about half way through the summer.

## Visit patterns over the summer

```{r}
p1 <- bird %>%
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = Date, fill = Species) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=100, position='dodge') + 
  labs(y='Number of IDs', x='', title='Rufous Migrates Away in July',
       subtitle = 'Annas are present in BC year-round') + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c('chartreuse3', 'chocolate2')) + 
  #facet_wrap('~Species') +
  theme_pubr() 

p2 <- bird %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = Date, fill = Species, y=after_stat(count)) + 
  geom_density(bw=10, position='fill', show.legend = F, colour =NA) + 
  labs(y='Proportion of IDs') + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c('chartreuse3', 'chocolate2'))+ 
  theme_pubr()


(p1 / p2) 

```
Here's a map made from citizen scientist data: each blue dot is a Rufous sighting reported to iNaturalist.

![](species_locations.gif) 


The Male Rufous leave earlier than the Female: they're almost all gone by July. The latest dates we have for *manually confirmed* Rufous visits are:

-   Male: July 5th 2021
-   Female : July 31st 2021

```{r}
p1 <- bird %>% 
  filter(Species == 'Rufous') %>%
  group_by(Month, Sex) %>% 
  filter(n() > 5) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = Month, fill = Sex, y=after_stat(count)) + 
  geom_bar(position='fill', colour =NA)  + 
  labs(y='Proportion of IDs') + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c('chocolate1', 'chocolate4'))+ 
  theme_pubr() + labs(title='Rufous')

p2 <- bird %>% 
  filter(Species == 'Annas') %>%
  group_by(Month, Sex) %>% 
  filter(n() > 5) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = Month, fill = Sex, y=after_stat(count)) + 
  geom_bar(position='fill', colour =NA) + 
  labs(y='Proportion of IDs') + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c('chartreuse1', 'chartreuse4'))+ 
  theme_pubr() + labs(title='Anna')

(p1) + (p2)
```

The Annas on the other hand, seem to hover around 1:3 Male to Female ID ratio, with the dramatic exception of April. This may have to do with female nesting behaviours, but we don't know for sure.

## Visiting Hours

I thought the hours of the day in which birds visit the feeder might give interesting insight into their behaviour. After poking around in the data, I found that visiting hours vary widely from month-to-month. In both species, we see a big dip in visits from 12-3pm in June. Our hypothesis is that this has to do with avoiding the sun or hottest temperatures in the middle of the day. June was an especially hot month for 2021, and there were lots of [forest fires](https://galiwatch.ca/posts/fires-2021). However, it's somewhat surprising to not also see this effect in July and August, which are generally similar to June in terms of weather.

```{r}
bird %>%
  filter(Species == 'Rufous') %>%
  filter(Date < ymd('2021-08-01')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Hour, fill = Sex)) + 
  geom_bar(position = 'stack') + facet_wrap("~Month", scales='free_y') +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c('chocolate1', 'chocolate4')) + 
  labs(title='Rufous visit times vary by month', y = 'Number of IDs') + 
  theme_pubr()

```

```{r}

bird %>%
  filter(Species == 'Annas') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Hour, fill = Sex)) + 
  geom_bar(position='stack') + facet_wrap("~Month", scales='free_y') + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c('chartreuse1', 'chartreuse4')) + 
  labs(title='Annas visit times vary by month', y = 'Number of IDs') + 
  theme_pubr()

```

## 


Now we'll make use of the data from our weather station. I've created a column `MergeTime` in both dataframes, to make it easy to merge the bird and weather data.

Read in and prepare the weather data

```{r}
weather <- #readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teaswamp-creations/galiwatch.ca/quarto-website/posts/hummer-data-cleaning-170323/WS_hours.csv') %>%
  read_csv('WS_hours.csv') %>%
  # retain only non-duplicates
  distinct() %>%
  # Clean up timestamps, convert to celsius
  mutate(Date = ymd(Date), 
         MergeTime = ymd_hms(paste(Date, Time)),
         `Temp C` = (`Outdoor Temperature F`-32) * (5/9)
         )
```

The air quality measures show the concentration of particulates at three different size thresholds (in micrometers), as well as the outdoor air temperature recorded from April - December 2021.

```{r, echo = T}
knitr::kable(head(weather))
```

## Temperature preferences

Based on the visiting hours plots, it seems like there may be a temperature effect in play, especially in June. To look into this, I made some linear regressions by month. There seemed to be some strong negative correlation in the hot months of June, July, August!

Relationship between temperature and number of visits differs by month.

```{r message=F, warning=F}

merge(bird, weather, all.x=T) %>%
  filter(Species=='Rufous') %>%
  filter(Date < ymd('2021-08-01')) %>% 
  group_by(Month, Hour, Species) %>%
  summarise(n=n(), temp = median(`Temp C`, na.rm=T), .groups='keep') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=temp, y = n))+ 
  geom_point(colour = 'chocolate2') + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm', colour = 'chocolate4') +
  labs(title='Rufous', x='Temperature (C)', y = 'Number of Visits')+
  facet_wrap("Month", nrow=2, scales = "free_y")+
  theme_pubr()
```

```{r}

merge(bird, weather, all.x=T) %>%
  filter(Species=='Annas') %>%
  group_by(Month, Hour, Species) %>%
  summarise(n=n(), temp = median(`Temp C`, na.rm=T), .groups='keep') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=temp, y = n))+ 
  geom_point(colour = 'chartreuse3') + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm', colour = 'chartreuse4') +
  labs(title='Anna', x='Temperature (C)', y = 'Number of Visits')+
  facet_wrap("Month", scales = "free_y")+ 
  theme_pubr()

```

Both species seem to dislike temperatures above 20 degrees C. There's a fairly strong month-specific effect - this may reflect some behaviour changes based on the Rufous migration
