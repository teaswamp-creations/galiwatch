        "Managed pollinators, most commonly honey bees, are super-generalist pollinators that are essential for, or enhance, the pollination and production of many agricultural crops. We rely heavily on honey bees for certain types of food production - for example they are considered essential to sustaining the global supply of almonds - and support billions of dollars worth of food production worldwide. So, it is very worrying that beekeepers report honeybee populations are dwindling, and that their colonies are becoming increasingly vulnerable to environmental stressors. \n",

        "Decline of bumble bees has been reported in North America and Europe and is of significant global concern.[^2] Although there are over 500 known bee species in British Columbia, there is not a lot of historical information about pollinator populations to use as a baseline. However, we do know that at least one bee species, the western bumble bee, *B. occidentalis*, has significantly declined.[^3] The authors discuss how this bee used to be very common in the lower mainland in the 1980s, representing 25-30% of bumble bee species collected on local berry farms, but by 2003/2004 had dwindled to less than 1% of the bees collected. Since then, *B. occidentalis* was sighted just a handful of times on Vancouver Island in 2012, and once in the lower mainland at Boundary Bay in 2013. According to a local newspaper report, it was last spotted on Galiano in 1990. In contrast however, it seems the yellow-faced bumble bee, *B. vosnesenskii*, may be gaining ground in the region.[^4] \n",

        "Galiano's bumble bees have recently been under scrutiny in a study to better understand their reliance on habitat diversity in this semi-arid\n",
        "ecosystem [^5]. The author identified six species of bumble bees that frequented flowering shrubs in various habitats through spring and summer, and saw fluctuations of bumble bee abundance in different habitats (wet, dry, modified, natural) as the summer progressed. Overall, the Vancouver bumble bee *B. vancouverensis* was the most abundant species, followed by the Sitka bumble bee *B. sitkensis*, while the yellow-faced bumble bee *B. vosnesenskii* was least abundant, perhaps reflecting it has only recently made it to the island. Bumble bee activity and blooming peaked in June in habitat similar to our study site, but even as flowering slowed high numbers of bumble bees were found to persist through July.  \n",
